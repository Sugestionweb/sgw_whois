# SGW Hosting

With this module you can make domain name queries to Whois databases.

The module includes the possibility of consulting more than 1000 top-level domain
extensions (TLD) and more than 240 geographic extensions (ccTLD) in about 1200 whois
servers. In addition, the module can be expanded with new whois and tld's servers.

Each domain extension can be linked to a product, so that, if the domain is available,
it can be purchased.

Note that the domain purchase operation through this module only places the order in
Odoo, the domain is not really registered, only the order is generated It's up to you to
register the domain manually in some domain registrar.

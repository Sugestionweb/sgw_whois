# SGW Hosting

With this module you can make domain name queries to Whois databases.

The module includes the possibility of consulting more than 600 top-level domain
extensions (TLD) and more than 240 geographic extensions (ccTLD).

In addition, each domain extension is linked to a product, so that, if the domain is
available, it can be purchased.

Note that the domain purchase operation through this module only places the order in
Odoo, the domain is not really registered, only the order is generated It's up to you to
register the domain in domain registrars.

Later, over time, the module may connect with one or more domain registrar APIs to
really register the domain, but this is not currently done.

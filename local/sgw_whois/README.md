# SGW Hosting

With this module you can make domain name queries to Whois databases.

The module includes the possibility of consulting more than 1000 top-level domain
extensions (TLD) and more than 240 geographic extensions (ccTLD) in about 1200 whois
servers. In addition, the module can be expanded with new whois and tld's servers.

Each domain extension can be linked to a product, so that, if the domain is available,
it can be purchased.

Note that the domain purchase operation through this module only places the order in
Odoo, the domain is not really registered, only the order is generated It's up to you to
register the domain manually in some domain registrar.

## Installation
Install the module like any other module, copying it to one of the folders included in the application path configured for Odoo. Refresh the list of applications and press the install button.

## Configuration
No extra configuration is really required except in rare cases. At the time of installation, the program configures itself with more than 1200 TLDs extracted from the iana.org website and with about 1000 Whois servers. You only need to add products for each domain you want to sell.

In the product definition page, two fields are added, one to indicate if the product is a TLD that you want to sell and another that indicates what TLD it is. Once the product is published, the domains can be sold as products.

The program includes a widget that you can drag and drop on any page using odoo website builder.
